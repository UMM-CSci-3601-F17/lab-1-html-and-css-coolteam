  Most of the modifications to these elements control their positioning and spacing between other
  divs. The relative position helps for responsiveness between screen sizes, although shrinking the screen
  will make the layout less aesthetically pleasing/symmetric. The font sizes are adaptive in this rule.
  There is some padding to make the interiors look more tidy. The inline-block
  helps them to appear side by side to each other and the other divs. If we had more time we would have liked to
  change the borders, colors, and fonts of these elements and the others in its class.

    This element was modified from the other two styles although it is still fixed to the page
    (mainly to make it easier to position). Instead of being fixed to the top of the page however,
    it is fixed to the right side (controlled by right).This change was made to accommodate the
    switch from a horizontal list to a vertical one, but that feature isn't controlled in this rule.
    Width is also adjusted for the vertical display (so it doesn't stretch across the screen),
    and top moves the bar to the center of the page.
