    Most of the modifications to this element control its positioning and spacing between other

    will make the layout less aesthetically pleasing/symmetric. The font sizes are adaptive in this rule.
    There is some padding to make the interior look more tidy. If we had more time we would have liked to
    change the borders, colors, and fonts of this element and the others in its class.

    This element was modified from the other two styles although it is still fixed to the page
    (mainly to make it easier to position). Instead of being fixed to the top of the page however,
    it is fixed to the right side (controlled by right).This change was made to accommodate the
    switch from a horizontal list to a vertical one, but that feature isn't controlled in this rule.
    Width is also adjusted for the vertical display (so it doesn't stretch across the screen),
    and top moves the bar to the center of the page.
